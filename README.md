# Automatic Lung Segmentation in Chest X-ray Images using U-Net

In this project, I developed a U-Net convolutional neural network model specifically designed for automated lung segmentation from chest X-ray images. The model was trained on a dataset of X-rays that included manually annotated lung masks. During training, I employed the Adam optimization algorithm and utilized the dice loss function, resulting in a dice coefficient of 0.8477. Additionally, I implemented an evaluation script to generate predicted lung masks for test images. These results were then saved alongside the original X-rays and ground truth masks for validation. Overall, this work represents a significant step toward accurate and efficient lung segmentation in medical imaging
